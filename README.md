# Voice-Translator-Desktop-App
Built a Python-based desktop app for real-time voice translation using Tkinter, SpeechRecognition, deep_translator, and gTTS. The app converts English speech to text, translates it into two selected languages, and provides both text and audio output. Implemented multi-threading for smooth, real-time performance.
